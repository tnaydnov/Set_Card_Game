# Set_Card_Game
The goal of the assignment is to practice concurrent programming on Java 8 environment, Java threads and Java Synchronization.
In this project, I implemented a Set game in which each player & the dealer is represented by a Java thread, and the goal is to make them running at the same time, in synchronization.
I also experience with Unit testing in-order to test the functionality of the project.
